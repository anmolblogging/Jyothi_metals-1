/**
 * Category-level overview content for the /products landing page.
 *
 * The catalogue in `catalogData` is grade-level (291 items) — far too granular
 * for a landing page. This module rolls it up to the ten main categories and
 * pairs each with the editorial copy the alternating product rows render.
 *
 * `slug` doubles as the section anchor id, so `/products?category=Round Bars`
 * and `/products#round-bars` both scroll to the same row.

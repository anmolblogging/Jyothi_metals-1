Every performance question about a stainless grade is really a question about whether that film can keep repairing itself in the environment you are putting it in.',

They adsorb onto the passive film at its weakest points — an inclusion, a grain boundary, a scratch, an area starved of oxygen — and break it down locally. Because the surrounding surface stays passive and cathodic, the tiny depassivated spot becomes a concentrated anode. Metal dissolves fast in a very small area. That is pitting, and it is why chloride attack is dangerous: the surface can look sound while a pit drives through the wall.',
